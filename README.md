## üôå Why Open Source?

Qualityfriend by holidayfriend.solutions was originally developed by a hotelier ‚Äì for his own family-run hotel in South Tyrol, Italy.  
The goal: to simplify operations, reduce paperwork, and bring clarity to the daily chaos of hotel life.

But why keep it to ourselves?

> **We believe that small and medium-sized hotels deserve great digital tools ‚Äì without high costs or complexity.**

That‚Äôs why Qualityfriend is now open source.  
Most of its features are free to use ‚Äì because software should support hospitality, not drain its resources.

If it helps us, maybe it can help you too.
